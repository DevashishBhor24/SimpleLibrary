# SimpleLibraryProgram in C++
The library management project in C++ is a simple program that allows users to manage a library's collection of books. Users can add books to the library by providing the title, author, and publication year. The program provides an option to display all the books in the library, listing their titles, authors, and publication years. Additionally, users can search for books by author, displaying a list of books written by a specific author. The project offers a basic yet functional library management system with essential features for organizing and accessing book information.
